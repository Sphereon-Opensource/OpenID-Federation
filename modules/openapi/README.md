# Open API specs

The Open API specs of OpenID Federation.

## Entity Statement

An Entity Statement contains the information needed for the Entity that is the subject of the Entity Statement to 
participate in federation(s). An Entity Statement is a signed JWT. The subject of the JWT is the Entity itself. The 
issuer of the JWT is the party that issued the Entity Statement. All Entities in a federation publish an Entity Statement 
about themselves called an Entity Configuration. Superior Entities in a federation publish Entity Statements about their
Immediate Subordinate Entities called Subordinate Statements.
